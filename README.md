# FEHAutoTools
Automated tasks such as rerolling

General setup:

Install AnkuLua here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appautomatic.ankulua.trial&hl=en  (more info on AnkuLua here: http://ankulua.boards.net/) 

On your device download desired script(s) and image.zip 

extract the image.zip folder

open up ankulua

either confirm root access or use the daemon installation: http://ankulua.boards.net/thread/3/daemon-installation

select the desired script in ankulua

open FEH and press play


-FEHFullReroll

Start with a fresh install, clear the app data through settings, or delete shared prefs

Start the script at the "Select Country" page and it should run through the download, opening scenes, tutorial and make a couple summons

demo here: https://youtu.be/kIu3qtsVivA (it's kind of boring though since it's just a screen capture. Should probably make a video of the device itself)
